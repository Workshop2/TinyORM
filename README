TinyORM is a small Object Relational Mapper (ORM) designed for MS SQL servers to convert tables into objects.

Currently supports Datatable -> Raw data types
							 -> Datatables & Datasets
							 -> Custom Objects (Column names and types must match the object properties exactly)
							 -> Lists of custom objects
							 
More features to come

TODO:
	- Multiple generics with multiple tables within a dataset
	- Saving Framework (TinyObject abstract?)
		- Attributes
		- Save directly to tables or SP's
	- Move exceptions into TinyException namespace
	- Maybe rename to the "TinyFramework"
	- TinyMapper: Option to ignore missing columns/properties?
