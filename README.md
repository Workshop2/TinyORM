TinyORM is a small Object Relational Mapper (ORM) designed for MS SQL servers to convert tables into objects.

Currently supports
===
- Datatable
    - Raw data types
    - Datatables & Datasets
	- Custom Objects (Column names and types must match the object properties exactly)
	- Lists of custom objects

More features to come

TODO:
	- Multiple generics with multiple tables within a dataset
	- Saving Framework (TinyObject abstract?)
		- Attributes
		- Save directly to tables or SP's
	- Maybe rename to the "TinyFramework"
	- TinyMapper: Option to ignore missing columns/properties?
